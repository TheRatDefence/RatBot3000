# Ratbot 3000 / 11SE Task 1
### Summary :
This is a small program I wrote for my 11SE assessment task along with other files such as a flowchart and structure chart. The program uses gemini through the google-genai library to generate a custom quiz based on the user's choice of topic and their specified amount of questions. 

### To install:
* Download the main.py and requirements.txt files
* Run "pip install -r requirements.txt"
### To run:
* Create a file named "api_key.txt" and put your gemini api key inside
* Run main.py
